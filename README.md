# Scheduler Showdown: Expansion
This project is designed to be an extension to the previous programming assignment Scheduler Showdown. The goal is to expand on the existing project by implementing more types of processes and more scheduling algorithms. 

The original assignment included:
- Round-Robin 
- Shortest Process Next 
- Shortest Remaining Time
- Highest Response Ratio Next. 

New scheduling algorithms will also include:
- First-In First-Out Scheduling (FIFO)
- Multilevel Scheduling (ML)
- Multilevel Feedback Scheduling (MLF)
- Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RM)
- Earliest Deadline First Scheduling (EDF)

These algorithms will be tested using different types of processes: batch processes, interactive processes, and real-time processes. Sample data will be created to simulate how each algorithm performs depending on the number of processes, duration of processes, time constraints, and other factors. The algorithms will be analyzed and compared for their effectiveness at handling certain process types or processes with certain features. Additionally, a linear regression learner (a type of artificially intelligent agent) could use these results to predict how a given algorithm would perform on a new process.
